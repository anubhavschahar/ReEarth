# 🌍 ReEarth – Where Recycling Meets Planet Restoration

ReEarth is a planet-first, subscription-based EPR compliance and verified recycling platform designed to help Indian businesses meet mandatory plastic recycling obligations in a transparent, predictable, and audit-safe way.

This repository contains an AI-generated prototype website built using Gemini AI and deployed via GitHub Pages as part of an AI-First Product Innovation Lab.

## 🚨 Problem

India generates millions of tonnes of plastic waste annually. Under EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) regulations, companies are legally required to recycle the same amount of plastic they introduce into the market.

However, current recycling systems are:
- Fragmented and manual  
- Prone to fake certificates  
- Unpredictable in cost  
- Difficult for SMEs to manage  
- High-risk during audits  

---

## 💡 Solution

ReEarth simplifies and verifies EPR compliance by offering:

- Subscription-based compliance plans  
- Verified recycler network  
- Digital, audit-safe EPR certificates  
- Real-time recycling dashboards  
- ESG & sustainability impact reporting  

ReEarth transforms plastic waste into verified planetary impact.
